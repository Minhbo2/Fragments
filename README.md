# Fragments
Fragments is my first attempt at dynamic level design combined with "time traveling" mechanic. The design circles around the idea of level shifting/changing as player activate time traveling mechanic in order to proceed forward. It is inspired by Crack in the Slab of Dishonored 2 by Arkane Studio. Crack in the Slab mission was design to have 2 levels running/rendering simultaneously within the same scene. My design took on a new approach: have different parts of the level to be rendering on different Layermask. By swapping Layermask, I was able to mimick "time traveling" effect combined with camera visual aid. 

## Rules:
1. R: activate time travel.
2. G: return to present. 

### Goal:
The goal is to escape this mysterious place by reaching the exit at the top of the clock tower. 

### Losing Condition:
Though the character is unable to die in this level, he will be forever trapped.
